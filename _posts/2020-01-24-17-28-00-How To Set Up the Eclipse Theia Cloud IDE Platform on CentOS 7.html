<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>With developer tools moving to the cloud, adoption of cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment) platforms is growing. Cloud IDEs are accessible from every type of modern device through web browsers, and they offer numerous advantages for real-time collaboration scenarios. Working in a cloud IDE provides a unified development and testing environment for you and your team, while minimizing platform incompatibilities. Accessible through web browsers, cloud IDEs are available from every type of modern device.</p>

<p><a href="https://theia-ide.org/">Eclipse Theia</a> is an extensible cloud IDE running on a remote server and accessible from a web browser. Visually, it’s designed to look and behave similarly to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio Code</a>, which means that it supports many programming languages, has a flexible layout, and has an integrated terminal. What separates Eclipse Theia from other cloud IDE software is its extensibility; it can be modified using custom extensions, which allow you to craft a cloud IDE suited to your needs.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll deploy Eclipse Theia to your CentOS 7 server using Docker Compose, a container orchestration tool. You&rsquo;ll expose it at your domain using <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy">nginx-proxy</a>, an automated system for Docker that simplifies the process of configuring Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy for a container. You&rsquo;ll also secure it using a free <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-let-s-encrypt">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt TLS certificate</a>, which you&rsquo;ll provision using its specialized <a href="https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion">add-on</a>. In the end, you&rsquo;ll have Eclipse Theia running on your CentOS 7 server available via HTTPS and requiring the user to log in.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>An CentOS 7 server with root privileges, and a secondary, non-root account. You can set this up by following our <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-centos-7">Initial Server Setup Guide for CentOS 7</a>.

</ul>

<h2 id="step-1-—-deploying-nginx-proxy-with-let-39-s-encrypt">Step 1 — Deploying nginx-proxy with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</h2>

<p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll deploy <code>nginx-proxy</code> and its Let&rsquo;s Encrypt <a href="https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion">add-on</a> using Docker Compose. This will enable automatic TLS certificate provisioning and renewal, so that when you deploy Eclipse Theia it will be accessible at your domain via HTTPS.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll store all files under <code>~/eclipse-theia</code>. Create the directory by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">mkdir ~/eclipse-theia
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Navigate to it:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">cd ~/eclipse-theia
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;ll store the Docker Compose configuration for <code>nginx-proxy</code> in a file named <code>nginx-proxy-compose.yaml</code>. Create it using your text editor:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">vi nginx-proxy-compose.yaml
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Add the following lines:</p>
<div class="code-label " title="~/eclipse-theia/nginx-proxy-compose.yaml">~/eclipse-theia/nginx-proxy-compose.yaml</div><pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">version: '2'

services:
  nginx-proxy:
    restart: always
    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "/etc/nginx/htpasswd:/etc/nginx/htpasswd"
      - "/etc/nginx/vhost.d"
      - "/usr/share/nginx/html"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro"
      - "/etc/nginx/certs"

  letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion:
    restart: always
    image: jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
    volumes_from:
      - "nginx-proxy"
</code></pre>
<p>Here you&rsquo;re defining two services that Docker Compose will run, <code>nginx-proxy</code> and its Let&rsquo;s Encrypt companion. For the proxy, you specify <code>jwilder/nginx-proxy</code> as the image, map HTTP and HTTPS ports, and define volumes that will be accessible to it during runtime.</p>

<p>Volumes are directories on your server that the defined service will have full access to, which you&rsquo;ll later use to set up user authentication. To achieve that, you&rsquo;ll make use of the first volume from the list, which maps the local <code>/etc/nginx/htpasswd</code> directory to the same one in the container. In that folder, <code>nginx-proxy</code> expects to find a file named exactly as the target domain, containing log-in credentials for user authentication in the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html"><code>htpasswd</code></a> format (<code>username:hashed_password</code>).</p>

<p>For the add-on, you name the Docker image and allow access to Docker&rsquo;s socket by defining a volume. Then, you specify that the add-on should inherit access to the volumes defined for <code>nginx-proxy</code>. Both services have <code>restart</code> set to <code>always</code>, which orders Docker to restart the containers in case of crash or system reboot.</p>

<p>Save and close the file.</p>

<p>Deploy the configuration by running:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">docker-compose -f nginx-proxy-compose.yaml up -d
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Here you pass in the <code>nginx-proxy-compose.yaml</code> filename to the <code>-f</code> parameter of the <code>docker-compose</code> command, which specifies the file to run. Then, you pass the <code>up</code> verb that instructs it to run the containers. The <code>-d</code> flag enables detached mode, which means that Docker Compose will run the containers in the background.</p>

<p>The final output will look like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;ve deployed <code>nginx-proxy</code> and its Let&rsquo;s Encrypt companion using Docker Compose. Now you&rsquo;ll move on to set up Eclipse Theia at your domain and secure it.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-—-deploying-dockerized-eclipse-theia">Step 2 — Deploying Dockerized Eclipse Theia</h2>

<p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll create a file containing any allowed log-in combinations that a user will need to input. Then, you&rsquo;ll deploy Eclipse Theia to your server using Docker Compose and expose it at your secured domain using <code>nginx-proxy</code>.</p>

<p>As explained in the previous step, <code>nginx-proxy</code> expects log-in combinations to be in a file named after the exposed domain, in the <code>htpasswd</code> format and stored under the <code>/etc/nginx/htpasswd</code> directory in the container. The local directory which maps to the virtual one does not need to be the same, as was specified in the <code>nginx-proxy</code> config.</p>

<p>To create log-in combinations, you&rsquo;ll first need to install <code>htpasswd</code> by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo yum install httpd-tools
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The <code>httpd-tools</code> package contains the <code>htpasswd</code> utility.</p>

<p>Create the <code>/etc/nginx/htpasswd</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/htpasswd
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Create a file that will store the logins for your domain:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo touch /etc/nginx/htpasswd/<span class="highlight">theia.your-domain</span>
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Remember to replace <code><span class="highlight">theia.your-domain</span></code> with your Eclipse Theia domain.</p>

<p>To add a username and password combination, run the following command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/htpasswd/<span class="highlight">theia.your-domain</span> <span class="highlight">username</span>
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Replace <code><span class="highlight">username</span></code> with the username you want to add. You&rsquo;ll be asked for a password twice. After providing it, <code>htpasswd</code> will add the username and hashed password pair to the end of the file. You can repeat this command for as many logins as you wish to add.</p>

<p>Now, you&rsquo;ll create configuration for deploying Eclipse Theia. You&rsquo;ll store it in a file named <code>eclipse-theia-compose.yaml</code>. Create it using your text editor:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">vi eclipse-theia-compose.yaml
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Add the following lines:</p>
<div class="code-label " title="~/eclipse-theia/eclipse-theia-compose.yaml">~/eclipse-theia/eclipse-theia-compose.yaml</div><pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">version: '2.2'

services:
  eclipse-theia:
    restart: always
    image: theiaide/theia:next
    init: true
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=<span class="highlight">theia.your-domain</span>
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=<span class="highlight">theia.your-domain</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this config, you define a single service called <code>eclipse-theia</code> with <code>restart</code> set to <code>always</code> and <code>theiaide/theia:next</code> as the container image. You also set <code>init</code> to <code>true</code> to instruct Docker to use <code>init</code> as the main process manager when running Eclipse Theia inside the container.</p>

<p>Then, you specify two environment variables in the <code>environment</code> section: <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> and <code>LETSENCRYPT_HOST</code>. The former is passed on to <code>nginx-proxy</code> and tells it at what domain the container should be exposed, while the latter is used by its Let&rsquo;s Encrypt add-on and specifies for which domain to request TLS certificates. Unless you specify a wildcard as the value for <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code>, they must be the same.</p>

<p>Remember to replace <code><span class="highlight">theia.your-domain</span></code> with your desired domain, then save and close the file.</p>

<p>Now deploy Eclipse Theia by running:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">docker-compose -f eclipse-theia-compose.yaml up -d
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The final output will look like:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>...

</code></pre>
<p>Then, in your browser, navigate to the domain you&rsquo;re using for Eclipse Theia. Your browser will show you a prompt asking you to log in. After providing the correct credentials, you&rsquo;ll enter Eclipse Theia and immediately see its editor GUI. In your address bar you&rsquo;ll see a padlock indicating that the connection is secure. If you don&rsquo;t see this immediately, wait a few minutes for the TLS certificates to provision, then reload the page.</p>

<p>Now that you can securely access your cloud IDE, you&rsquo;ll start using the editor in the next step.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-—-using-the-eclipse-theia-interface">Step 3 — Using the Eclipse Theia Interface</h2>

<p>In this section, you’ll explore some of the features of the Eclipse Theia interface.</p>

<p>On the left-hand side of the IDE, there is a vertical row of four buttons opening the most commonly used features in a side panel.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eclipse-kubernetes-cloud-ide/step4a.png" alt="Eclipse Theia GUI - Sidepanel"></p>

<p>This bar is customizable so you can move these views to a different order or remove them from the bar. By default, the first view opens the Explorer panel that provides tree-like navigation of the project&rsquo;s structure. You can manage your folders and files here—creating, deleting, moving, and renaming them as necessary.</p>

<p>After creating a new file through the <strong>File</strong> menu, you&rsquo;ll see an empty file open in a new tab. Once saved, you can view the file&rsquo;s name in the Explorer side panel. To create folders right click on the Explorer sidebar and click on <strong>New Folder</strong>. You can expand a folder by clicking on its name as well as dragging and dropping files and folders to upper parts of the hierarchy to move them to a new location.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eclipse-kubernetes-cloud-ide/step4b.png" alt="Eclipse Theia GUI - New Folder"></p>

<p>The next two options provide access to search and replace functionality. Following it, the next one provides a view of source control systems that you may be using, such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/download">Git</a>.</p>

<p>The final view is the debugger option, which provides all the common actions for debugging in the panel. You can save debugging configurations in the <code>launch.json</code> file.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eclipse-kubernetes-cloud-ide/step4c.png" alt="Debugger View with launch.json open"></p>

<p>The central part of the GUI is your editor, which you can separate by tabs for your code editing. You can change your editing view to a grid system or to side-by-side files. Like all modern IDEs, Eclipse Theia supports syntax highlighting for your code.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eclipse-kubernetes-cloud-ide/step4d.png" alt="Editor Grid View"></p>

<p>You can gain access to a terminal by typing <code>CTRL+SHIFT+`</code>, or by clicking on <strong>Terminal</strong> in the upper menu, and selecting <strong>New Terminal</strong>. The terminal will open in a lower panel and its working directory will be set to the project&rsquo;s workspace, which contains the files and folders shown in the Explorer side panel.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eclipse-kubernetes-cloud-ide/step4e.png" alt="Terminal open"></p>

<p>You’ve explored a high-level overview of the Eclipse Theia interface and reviewed some of the most commonly used features.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>You now have Eclipse Theia, a versatile cloud IDE, installed on your CentOS 7 server using Docker Compose and <code>nginx-proxy</code>. You&rsquo;ve secured it with a free Let&rsquo;s Encrypt TLS certificate and set up the instance to require log-in credentials from the user. You can work on your source code and documents with it individually or collaborate with your team. You can also try building your own version of Eclipse Theia if you need additional functionality. For further information on how to do that, visit the <a href="https://theia-ide.org/docs/composing_applications/">Theia docs</a>.</p>
