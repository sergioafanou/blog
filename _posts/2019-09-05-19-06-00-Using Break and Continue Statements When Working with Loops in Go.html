<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Using <strong>for loops</strong> in Go allow you to automate and repeat tasks in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>Learning how to control the operation and flow of loops will allow for customized logic in your program.  You can control your loops with the <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements.</p>

<h2 id="break-statement">Break Statement</h2>

<p>In Go, the <code>break</code> statement terminates execution of the current loop. A <code>break</code> is almost always paired with a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-conditional-statements-in-go">conditional <code>if</code> statement</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example that uses the <code>break</code> statement in a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<div class="code-label " title="break.go">break.go</div><pre class="code-pre "><code class="code-highlight language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        if i == 5 {
            fmt.Println("Breaking out of loop")
            break // break here
        }
        fmt.Println("The value of i is", i)
    }
    fmt.Println("Exiting program")
}
</code></pre>
<p>This small program creates a <code>for</code> loop that will iterate while <code>i</code> is less than <code>10</code>.</p>

<p>Within the <code>for</code> loop, there is an <code>if</code> statement.  The <code>if</code> statement tests the condition of <code>i</code> to see if the value is less than <code>5</code>. If the value of <code>i</code> is not equal to <code>5</code>, the loop continues and prints out the value of <code>i</code>. If the value of <code>i</code> is equal to <code>5</code>, the loop will execute the <code>break</code> statement, print that it is <code>Breaking out of loop</code>,  and stop executing the loop. At the end of the program we print out <code>Exiting program</code> to signify that we have exited the loop.</p>

<p>When we run this code, our output will be the following:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>The value of i is 0
The value of i is 1
The value of i is 2
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 4
Breaking out of loop
Exiting program
</code></pre>
<p>This shows that once the integer <code>i</code> is evaluated as equivalent to 5, the loop breaks, as the program is told to do so with the <code>break</code> statement.</p>

<h3 id="nested-loops">Nested Loops</h3>

<p>It is important to remember that the <code>break</code> statement will only stop the execution of the inner most loop it is called in.  If you have a nested set of loops, you will need a break for each loop if desired.</p>
<div class="code-label " title="nested.go">nested.go</div><pre class="code-pre "><code class="code-highlight language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for outer := 0; outer &lt; 5; outer++ {
        if outer == 3 {
            fmt.Println("Breaking out of outer loop")
            break // break here
        }
        fmt.Println("The value of outer is", outer)
        for inner := 0; inner &lt; 5; inner++ {
            if inner == 2 {
                fmt.Println("Breaking out of inner loop")
                break // break here
            }
            fmt.Println("The value of inner is", inner)
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("Exiting program")
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this program, we have two loops. While both loops iterate 5 times, each has a conditional <code>if</code> statement with a <code>break</code> statement. The outer loop will break if the value of <code>outer</code> equals <code>3</code>.  The inner loop will break if the value of <code>inner</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>If we run the program, we can see the output:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>The value of outer is 0
The value of inner is 0
The value of inner is 1
Breaking out of inner loop
The value of outer is 1
The value of inner is 0
The value of inner is 1
Breaking out of inner loop
The value of outer is 2
The value of inner is 0
The value of inner is 1
Breaking out of inner loop
Breaking out of outer loop
Exiting program
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that each time the inner loop breaks, the outer loop does not break. This is because <code>break</code> will only break the inner most loop it is called from.</p>

<p>We have seen how using <code>break</code> will stop the execution of a loop.  Next, let&rsquo;s look at how we can continue the iteration of a loop.</p>

<h2 id="continue-statement">Continue Statement</h2>

<p>The <code>continue</code> statement is used when you want to skip the remaining portion of the loop, and return to the top of the loop and continue a new iteration.</p>

<p>As with the <code>break</code> statement, the <code>continue</code> statement is commonly used with a conditional <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>Using the same <code>for</code> loop program as in the preceding <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-break-and-continue-statements-when-working-with-loops-in-go#break-statement">Break Statement</a> section, we’ll use a <code>continue</code> statement rather than a <code>break</code> statement:</p>
<div class="code-label " title="continue.go">continue.go</div><pre class="code-pre "><code class="code-highlight language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        if i == 5 {
            fmt.Println("Continuing loop")
            continue // break here
        }
        fmt.Println("The value of i is", i)
    }
    fmt.Println("Exiting program")
}
</code></pre>
<p>The difference in using the <code>continue</code> statement rather than a <code>break</code> statement is that our code will continue despite the disruption when the variable <code>i</code> is evaluated as equivalent to <code>5</code>. Let’s look at our output:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>The value of i is 0
The value of i is 1
The value of i is 2
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 4
Continuing loop
The value of i is 6
The value of i is 7
The value of i is 8
The value of i is 9
Exiting program
</code></pre>
<p>Here we see that the line <code>The value of i is 5</code> never occurs in the output, but the loop continues after that point to print lines for the numbers 6-10 before leaving the loop.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>continue</code> statement to avoid deeply nested conditional code, or to optimize a loop by eliminating frequently occurring cases that you would like to reject.</p>

<p>The <code>continue</code> statement causes a program to skip certain factors that come up within a loop, but then continue through the rest of the loop.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements in Go will allow you to use <code>for</code> loops more effectively in your code.</p>
