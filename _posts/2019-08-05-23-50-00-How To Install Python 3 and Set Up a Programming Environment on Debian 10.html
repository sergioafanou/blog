<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Python is a flexible and versatile programming language suitable for many use cases, including scripting, automation, data analysis, machine learning, and back-end development. First published in 1991 with a name inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, the development team wanted to make Python a language that was fun to use. Quick to set up with immediate feedback on errors, Python is a useful language to learn for beginners and experienced developers alike. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-2-vs-python-3-practical-considerations-2">Python 3 is the most current version</a> of the language and is considered to be the future of Python.  </p>

<p>This tutorial will get your Debian 10 server set up with a Python 3 programming environment. Programming on a server has many advantages and supports collaboration across development projects. </p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>In order to complete this tutorial, you should have a non-root user with <code>sudo</code> privileges on a Debian 10 server. To learn how to achieve this setup, follow our <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-debian-10">Debian 10 initial server setup guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re not already familiar with a terminal environment, you may find the article “<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal">An Introduction to the Linux Terminal</a>” useful for becoming better oriented with the terminal.</p>

<p>With your server and user set up, you are ready to begin.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-—-setting-up-python-3">Step 1 — Setting Up Python 3</h2>

<p>Debian Linux ships with both Python 3 and Python 2 pre-installed. To make sure that our versions are up-to-date, let’s update and upgrade the system with the <code>apt</code> command to work with the <strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>P</strong>ackaging <strong>T</strong>ool:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo apt update
</li><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo apt -y upgrade
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The <code>-y</code> flag will confirm that we are agreeing for all items to be installed. </p>

<p>Once the process is complete, we can check the version of Python 3 that is installed in the system by typing: </p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">python3 -V
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>You’ll receive output in the terminal window that will let you know the version number. While this number may vary, the output will be similar to this:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>Python <span class="highlight">3.7.3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To manage software packages for Python, let’s install <strong>pip</strong>, a tool that will install and manage programming packages we may want to use in our development projects. You can learn more about modules or packages that you can install with pip by reading “<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-modules-in-python-3">How To Import Modules in Python 3</a>.”</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo apt install -y python3-pip
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Python packages can be installed by typing:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">pip3 install <span class="highlight">package_name</span>
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code><span class="highlight">package_name</span></code> can refer to any Python package or library, such as Django for web development or NumPy for scientific computing. So if you would like to install NumPy, you can do so with the command <code>pip3 install numpy</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few more packages and development tools to install to ensure that we have a robust set-up for our programming environment:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Once Python is set up, and pip and other tools are installed, we can set up a virtual environment for our development projects.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-—-setting-up-a-virtual-environment">Step 2 —  Setting Up a Virtual Environment</h2>

<p>Virtual environments enable you to have an isolated space on your server for Python projects, ensuring that each of your projects can have its own set of dependencies that won’t disrupt any of your other projects.</p>

<p>Setting up a programming environment provides us with greater control over our Python projects and over how different versions of packages are handled. This is especially important when working with third-party packages. </p>

<p>You can set up as many Python programming environments as you want. Each environment is basically a directory or folder on your server that has a few scripts in it to make it act as an environment. </p>

<p>While there are a few ways to achieve a programming environment in Python, we’ll be using the <strong>venv</strong> module here, which is part of the standard Python 3 library. Let’s install venv by typing:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">sudo apt install -y python3-venv
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>With this installed, we are ready to create environments. Let’s either choose which directory we would like to put our Python programming environments in, or create a new directory with <code>mkdir</code>, as in:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">mkdir <span class="highlight">environments</span>
</li><li class="line" prefix="$">cd <span class="highlight">environments</span>
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Once you are in the directory where you would like the environments to live, you can create an environment by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">python3.7 -m venv <span class="highlight">my_env</span>
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, <code>pyvenv</code> sets up a new directory that contains a few items which we can view with the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">ls my_env
</li></ul></code></pre><pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>bin include lib lib64 pyvenv.cfg share
</code></pre>
<p>Together, these files work to make sure that your projects are isolated from the broader context of your local machine, so that system files and project files don’t mix. This is good practice for version control and to ensure that each of your projects has access to the particular packages that it needs. Python Wheels, a built-package format for Python that can speed up your software production by reducing the number of times you need to compile, will be in the Ubuntu 18.04 <code>share</code> directory.</p>

<p>To use this environment, you need to activate it, which you can achieve by typing the following command that calls the <strong>activate</strong> script:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">source <span class="highlight">my_env</span>/bin/activate
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Your command prompt will now be prefixed with the name of your environment, in this case it is called <span class="highlight">my_env</span>. Depending on what version of Debian Linux you are running, your prefix may appear somewhat differently, but the name of your environment in parentheses should be the first thing you see on your line:</p>
<pre class="code-pre custom_prefix"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="(my_env) sammy@ubuntu:~/environments$">
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>This prefix lets us know that the environment <span class="highlight">my_env</span> is currently active, meaning that when we create programs here they will use only this particular environment’s settings and packages. </p>

<p><span class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Within the virtual environment, you can use the command <code>python</code> instead of <code>python3</code>, and <code>pip</code> instead of <code>pip3</code> if you would prefer. If you use Python 3 on your machine outside of an environment, you will need to use the <code>python3</code> and <code>pip3</code> commands exclusively. <br></span></p>

<p>After following these steps, your virtual environment is ready to use.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-—-creating-a-“hello-world”-program">Step 3 — Creating a “Hello, World” Program</h2>

<p>Now that we have our virtual environment set up, let’s create a traditional “Hello, World!” program. This will let us test our environment and provides us with the opportunity to become more familiar with Python if we aren’t already.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll open up a command-line text editor such as nano and create a new file:</p>
<pre class="code-pre custom_prefix"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="(my_env) sammy@ubuntu:~/environments$">nano hello.py
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Once the text file opens up in the terminal window we’ll type out our program:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code class="code-highlight language-python">print("Hello, World!")
</code></pre>
<p>Exit nano by typing the <code>CTRL</code> and <code>X</code> keys, and when prompted to save the file press <code>y</code>. </p>

<p>Once you exit out of nano and return to your shell, let’s run the program:</p>
<pre class="code-pre custom_prefix"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="(my_env) sammy@ubuntu:~/environments$">python hello.py
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The <code>hello.py</code> program that you just created should cause your terminal to produce the following output:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<p>To leave the environment, simply type the command <code>deactivate</code> and you will return to your original directory. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Congratulations! At this point you have a Python 3 programming environment set up on your Debian 10 Linux server and you can now begin a coding project!</p>
