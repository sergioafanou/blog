<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Version control isn&rsquo;t just for code. It&rsquo;s for anything you want to track, including content. Using <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> to manage your next writing project gives you the ability to view multiple drafts at the same time,  see differences between those drafts, and even roll back to a previous version. And if you&rsquo;re comfortable doing so, you can then share your work with others on GitHub or other central Git repositories.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you&rsquo;ll use Git to manage a small Markdown document. You&rsquo;ll store an initial version, commit it, make changes, view the difference between those changes, and review the previous version. When you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll have a workflow you can apply to your own writing projects.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<li>Git installed on your local computer. The tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-getting-started-with-git">How to Contribute to Open Source: Getting Started with Git</a> walks you through installing Git and covers some background information you may find useful. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-1-—-creating-a-workspace-for-your-writing-project">Step 1 — Creating a Workspace for Your Writing Project</h2>

<p>To manage your changes, you&rsquo;ll create a local Git repository. A Git repository lives inside of an existing directory, so start by creating a new directory for your article:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">mkdir article
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Switch to the new <code>article</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">cd article
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The <code>git init</code> command creates a new empty Git repository in the current directory. Execute that command now:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git init
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the following output which confirms your repository was created:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/sammy/article/.git/
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.gitignore</code> file lets you tell Git that some files should be ignored. You can use this to ignore temporary files your text editor might create, or operating systems files. On macOS, for example, the Finder application creates <code>.DS_Store</code> files in directories.  Create a <code>.gitignore</code> file that ignores them:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">nano .gitignore
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Add the following lines to the file:</p>
<div class="code-label " title=".gitignore">.gitignore</div><pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""># Ignore Finder files
.DS_store
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is a comment, which will help you identify what you&rsquo;re ignoring in the future. The second line specifies the file to ignore.</p>

<p>Save the file and exit the editor.</p>

<p>As you discover more files you want to ignore, open the <code>.gitignore</code> file and add a new line for each file or directory you want to ignore. </p>

<p>Now that your repository is configured, you can start working.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-—-saving-your-initial-draft">Step 2 — Saving Your Initial Draft</h2>

<p>Git only knows about files you tell it about. Just because a file exists in the directory holding the repository doesn&rsquo;t mean Git will track its changes. You have to add a file to the repository and then commit the changes.</p>

<p>Create a new Markdown file called <code>article.md</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">nano article.md
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Add some text to the file:</p>
<div class="code-label " title="article.md">article.md</div><pre class="code-pre "><code class="code-highlight language-markdown"># How To Use Git to Manage Your Writing Project

### Introduction

Version control isn't just for code. It's for anything you want to track, including content. Using Git to manage your next writing project gives you the ability to view multiple drafts at the same time,  see differences between those drafts, and even roll back to a previous version. And if you're comfortable doing so, you can then share your work with others on GitHub or other central git repositories.

In this tutorial you'll use Git to manage a small Markdown document. You'll store an initial version, commit it, make changes, view the difference between those changes, and review the previous version. When you're done, you'll have a workflow you can apply to your own writing projects.
</code></pre>
<p>Save the changes and exit the editor.</p>

<p>The <code>git status</code> command will show you the state of your repository. It will show you what files need to be added so Git can track them. Run this command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git status
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see this output:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

    <span class="highlight">.gitignore</span>
    <span class="highlight">article.md</span>

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>
<p>In the output, the <code>Untracked files</code> section shows the files that Git isn&rsquo;t looking at. These files need to be added to the repository so Git can watch them for changes. Use the <code>git add</code> command to do this:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git add .gitignore
</li><li class="line" prefix="$">git add article.md
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Now run <code>git status</code> to verify those files have been added:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    <span class="highlight">new file:   .gitignore</span>
    <span class="highlight">new file:   article.md</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Both files are now listed in the <code>Changes to be committed</code> section.  Git knows about them, but it hasn&rsquo;t created a snapshot of the work yet. Use the <code>git commit</code> command to do that.</p>

<p>When you create a new commit, you need to provide a commit message. A good commit message states what your changes are. When you&rsquo;re working with others, the more detailed your commit messages are, the better.</p>

<p>Use the command <code>git commit</code> to commit your changes:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git commit -m "Add gitignore file and initial version of article"
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The output of the command shows that the files were committed:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>[master (root-commit) 95fed84] Add gitignore file and initial version of article
 <span class="highlight">2</span> files changed, <span class="highlight">9</span> insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 <span class="highlight">.gitignore</span>
 create mode 100644 <span class="highlight">article.md</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use the <code>git status</code> command to see the state of the repository:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git status
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The output shows there are no changes that need to be added or committed.</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at how to work with changes.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-—-saving-revisions">Step 3 — Saving Revisions</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve added your initial version of the article. Now you&rsquo;ll add more text so you can see how to manage changes with Git.</p>

<p>Open the article in your editor:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">nano article.md
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Add some more text to the end of the file:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code class="code-highlight language-markdown">## Prerequisites

* Git installed on your local computer. The tutorial [How to Contribute to Open Source: Getting Started with Git](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-getting-started-with-git) walks you through installing Git and covers some background information you may find useful. 
</code></pre>
<p>Save the file.</p>

<p>Use the <code>git status</code> command to see where things stand in your repository:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git status
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The output shows there are changes:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    <span class="highlight">modified:   article.md</span>

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

</code></pre>
<p>As expected, the <code>article.md</code> file has changes.  </p>

<p>Use <code>git diff</code> to see what they are:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git diff article.md
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The output shows the lines you&rsquo;ve added:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In the output, lines starting with a plus (+) sign are lines you added.  Lines that were removed would show up with a minus (-) sign. Lines that were unchanged would have neither of these characters in front.</p>

<p>Using <code>git diff</code> and <code>git status</code> is a helpful way to see what you&rsquo;ve changed. You can also save the diff to a file so you can view it later with the following command:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git diff article.md &gt; article_diff.diff
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>.diff</code> extension will help your text editor apply the proper syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>Saving the changes to your repository is a two-step process. First, add the <code>article.md</code> file again, and then commit.  Git wants you to explicitly tell it which files go in every commit, so even though you added the file before, you have to add it again. Note that the output from the <code>git status</code> command reminds you of that.</p>

<p>Add the file and then commit the changes, providing a commit message:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git add article.md
</li><li class="line" prefix="$">git commit -m "add prerequisites section"
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The output verifies that the commit worked:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">[seondary_label Output]
[master 1fbfc21] add prerequisites section
 <span class="highlight">1</span> file changed, <span class="highlight">4</span> insertions(+)
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>git status</code> to see your repository status. You&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s nothing else to do.</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git status
</li></ul></code></pre><pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p>Continue this process as you revise your article. Make changes, verify them, add the file, and commit the changes with a detailed message. Commit your changes as often or as little as you feel comfortable. You might perform a commit after you finish each draft, or right before you do a major rework of your article&rsquo;s structure.</p>

<p>If you send a draft of a document to someone else and they make changes to it, take their copy and replace your file with theirs.  Then use <code>git diff</code> to see the changes they made quickly. Git will see the changes whether you typed them in directly or replaced the file with one you downloaded from the web, email, or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at managing the versions of your article.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-—-managing-changes">Step 4 — Managing Changes</h2>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s helpful to look at a previous version of a document.  Whenever you&rsquo;ve used <code>git commit</code>, you&rsquo;ve supplied a helpful message that summarizes what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p>The <code>git log</code> command shows you the commit history of your repository. Every change you&rsquo;ve committed has an entry in the log.</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git log
</li></ul></code></pre><pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>commit 1fbfc2173f3cec0741e0a6b21803fbd0be511bc4

Date:   Thu Sep 19 16:32:34 2019 -0500

    Add gitignore file and initial version of article
</code></pre>
<p>Each commit has a specific identifier. You use this number to reference a specific commit&rsquo;s changes.  You only need the first several characters of the identifier though. The <code>git log --oneline</code> command gives you a condensed version of the log with shorter identifiers:</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git log --oneline
</li></ul></code></pre><pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div><span class="highlight">1fbfc21</span> add prerequisites section
<span class="highlight">95fed84</span> Add gitignore file and initial version of article
</code></pre>
<p>To view the initial version of your file, use <code>git show</code> and the commit identifier. The identifiers in your repository will be different than the ones in these examples.</p>
<pre class="code-pre command"><code langs=""><ul class="prefixed"><li class="line" prefix="$">git show <span class="highlight">95fed84</span> article.md
</li></ul></code></pre>
<p>The output shows the commit detail, as well as the changes that happened during that commit:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""><div class="secondary-code-label " title="Output">Output</div>commit 95fed849b0205c49eda994fff91ec03642d59c79

<p>As you make more changes, your log will grow, and you&rsquo;ll be able to review all of the changes  you&rsquo;ve made to your article over time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this tutorial you used a local Git repository to track the changes in your writing project. You can use this approach to manage individual articles, all the posts for your blog, or even your next novel. And if you push your repository to GitHub, you can invite others to help you edit your work. </p>
