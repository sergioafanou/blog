Forgive us for getting confused in our headline.

Chinese smartphone maker OPPO today <a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/about-us/press/oppo-watch-makes-its-debut-with-built-in-cellular-and-flexible-hyperboloid-display/">introduced its first smartwatch</a>, the OPPO Watch, with a so-called "signature design" that just so happens to look virtually identical to the Apple Watch. "This might be the best-looking smart watch of the year," said OPPO's vice president of marketing Brian Shen.

<br/>
The OPPO Watch uses OPPO's custom Android-based operating system ColorOS and offers the functionality you would expect from a smartwatch, including notifications, fitness and heart rate tracking, contactless payments, music playback, breathing reminders, and so forth. It also has built-in eSIM-based cellular connectivity.

<br/>
Unlike the Apple Watch, the OPPO Watch can monitor sleep quality, generating a sleep report of the user's duration of deep sleep, light sleep, and awake time. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/02/apple-watch-sleep-tracking-and-schooltime/">MacRumors uncovered evidence of Apple testing sleep tracking on the Apple Watch</a> last year and reports have indicated that the feature could be on deck for 2020.

<br/>
OPPO Watch will be sold worldwide, with availability beginning in China on March 24. The 46mm version features a 1.91-inch AMOLED display with a 402x476 resolution for 326 pixels per inch. U.S. pricing remains to be seen.<br/><br/><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/oppo/">Oppo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/06/oppo-apple-watch-clone/">OPPO Introduces the Apple Watch… Wait</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oppo-introduces-the-apple-watch…-wait.2225694/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class="feedflare">
